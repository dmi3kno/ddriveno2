  abstract = {A bivariate distribution is not determined by the knowledge of the margins. Two bivariate distributions with exponential margins are analyzed and another is briefly mentioned. In the first distribution (2.1) the conditional expectation of one variable decreases to zero with increasing values of the other one. The coefficient of correlation is never positive and lies in the interval -.40 ≤ ρ ≤ 0, and the correlation ratio varies from -.48 to zero. In the second distribution (3.4) the conditional expectation of one variable increases or decreases with increasing values of the other variable depending on the sign of the correlation. The coefficient of correlation lies in the interval -.25 ≤ ρ ≤ .25, and the correlation ratio is proportional to the coefficient.},

  abstract = {Recently it has been observed that the generalized exponential distribution can be used quite effectively to analyze lifetime data in one dimension. The main aim of this paper is to define a bivariate generalized exponential distribution so that the marginals have generalized exponential distributions. It is observed that the joint probability density function, the joint cumulative distribution function and the joint survival distribution function can be expressed in compact forms. Several properties of this distribution have been discussed. We suggest to use the EM algorithm to compute the maximum likelihood estimators of the unknown parameters and also obtain the observed and expected Fisher information matrices. One data set has been re-analyzed and it is observed that the bivariate generalized exponential distribution provides a better fit than the bivariate exponential distribution.},

But, the general properties of bivariate quantile functions have not been considered in their work. In the present paper, we carry out a preliminary study on the properties of bivariate distributions represented through quantile functions. The uses of the new results are illustrated in the case of a bivariate quantile function model by deriving their properties and then applying them to real data.},

  abstract = {This paper extends the application of Bayesian inference to probability distributions defined in terms of its quantile function. We describe the method of *indirect likelihood* to be used in the Bayesian models with sampling distributions which lack an explicit cumulative distribution function. We provide examples and demonstrate the equivalence of the "quantile-based" (indirect) likelihood to the conventional "density-defined" (direct) likelihood. We consider practical aspects of the numerical inversion of quantile function by root-finding required by the indirect likelihood method. In particular, we consider a problem of ensuring the validity of an arbitrary quantile function with the help of Chebyshev polynomials and provide useful tips and implementation of these algorithms in Stan and R. We also extend the same method to propose the definition of an *indirect prior* and discuss the situations where it can be useful},
