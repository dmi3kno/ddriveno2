  abstract = {A bivariate distribution is not determined by the knowledge of the margins. Two bivariate distributions with exponential margins are analyzed and another is briefly mentioned. In the first distribution (2.1) the conditional expectation of one variable decreases to zero with increasing values of the other one. The coefficient of correlation is never positive and lies in the interval -.40 ≤ ρ ≤ 0, and the correlation ratio varies from -.48 to zero. In the second distribution (3.4) the conditional expectation of one variable increases or decreases with increasing values of the other variable depending on the sign of the correlation. The coefficient of correlation lies in the interval -.25 ≤ ρ ≤ .25, and the correlation ratio is proportional to the coefficient.},

  abstract = {Recently it has been observed that the generalized exponential distribution can be used quite effectively to analyze lifetime data in one dimension. The main aim of this paper is to define a bivariate generalized exponential distribution so that the marginals have generalized exponential distributions. It is observed that the joint probability density function, the joint cumulative distribution function and the joint survival distribution function can be expressed in compact forms. Several properties of this distribution have been discussed. We suggest to use the EM algorithm to compute the maximum likelihood estimators of the unknown parameters and also obtain the observed and expected Fisher information matrices. One data set has been re-analyzed and it is observed that the bivariate generalized exponential distribution provides a better fit than the bivariate exponential distribution.},

  abstract = {Recently, Vineshkumar and Nair (2019) have discussed the applications of bivariate quantile functions in the context of reliability analysis. But, the general properties of bivariate quantile functions have not been considered in their work. In the present paper, we carry out a preliminary study on the properties of bivariate distributions represented through quantile functions. The uses of the new results are illustrated in the case of a bivariate quantile function model by deriving their properties and then applying them to real data.},
