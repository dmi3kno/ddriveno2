This is my attempt to re-start the old blog which collapsed under the weight of the Hugo theme updates and my inability to keep the configuration current. I am restarting the blog in Quarto, rendered with Github Action, hoping this could be a longer-term solution with full Mathjax support and cross-referencing.

I plan to migrate some of the older posts to the new platform if and when the time allows. Many of them need to be updated and/or re-rendered to be compatible with the Quarto format. Since it looks like a lot of work at the moment, I will prioritize it when the opportunity presents itself.

Again, welcome to my blog and enjoy!
